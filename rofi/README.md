# Rofi: Elegant Vagrant

This is a minimal `rofi` configuration that tries keep out of your way by not blocking elements from `rofi` while creating custom scripts. The [fuzzel](https://github.com/janpstrunn/elegantvagrant/tree/main/fuzzel) theme is a great alternative to `rofi`.

## Footages

## Plans

The `rofi` configuration is currently completed. There is not change to be made.
